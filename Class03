what are the lists : 


There are lots of occasions when we 
need to use lists. HTML provides us with 
three different types:
● Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is 
numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for 
a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract 
where each point needs to be identified by a section 
number.

you create it by - <ol> and then the <li> on each line to list the numbers 
● Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point 
(rather than characters that indicate order). 

to create it you put <ul> then <li> in this case the li will list the bullets and not the numbers 


● Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the 
definitions for each of those terms
to create it we have to add the <dl > <dt> <dd> 

eventually : the nested lists ul inside a ul or ol inside an ol
