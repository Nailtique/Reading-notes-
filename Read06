JavaScript Functions:

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task, it is executed when it is called, or something calls it. 

**Example**
function myFunction(p1, p2) {
  return p1 * p2;   // The function returns the product of p1 and p2


  **Why Functions?**
You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times, as using the same code but with different argunebs to produce different results, this will save us time and efforts.
