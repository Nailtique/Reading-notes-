When creating a web page, you add tags or markups that provide extra meaning 
and allow browsers to show users the 
appropriate structure for the page.

we will learn here : 

● Structural markup: the elements that you can use to 
describe both headings and paragraphs

● Semantic markup: which provides extra information; such 
as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something 
you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the 
meaning of acronyms, and so on


so lets go through brielfy : 

1- the headers, the footers, the whote space, the SUB, the SUP the BR 
the b, the i - which are all useful elements that we have an idea about since we all used the word and so on.
if i also want t o create a space in a line bbwtewwn the topics i use the hr it will give that to have a break betwween pages 

there is also the visual editors - they respeble the word processors, you can have short cuts to have that font change, like you click on the shift key and the return jey at the same time to get a line break. 
we need to aslo be carfeul when we copy and paste the texts, as some progrmas allows you to format the text - like word, it may add extra markups, to prevent that just paste the text on a plain text editior then copy it again 
now what are the semantic changes :
There are some text elements that are not intended to affect the 
structure of your web pages, but they do add extra information to the 
pages — they are known as semantic markup.

The reason for using these 
elements is that other programs, 
such as screen readers or search 
engines, can use this extra 
information. For example, the 
voice of a screen reader may add 
emphasis to the words inside 
the <em> element, or a search 
engine might register that your 
page features a quote if you use 
the <blockquote> element

  
  
  now intorducing the CSS : 
  The key to understanding how CSS works is to 
imagine that there is an invisible box around 
every HTML element
  
  lets cut them down : 
  
  1- block and inline elements :
  lock level elements look 
like they start on a new line. 
Examples include the <h1>-
<h6>, <p> and <div> elements.
Inline elements flow within the 
text and do not start on a new 
line. Examples include <b>, <i>, 
<img>, <em> and <span>.
  
  with CSS - you can use it internal CSS, or external CSS, and the CSS sleectors, the best practice is the external CSS- more neat.
  All of your web pages can share 
the same style sheet. This is 
achieved by using the <link>
element on each HTML page of 
your site to link to the same CSS 
document. This means that the 
same code does not need to be 
repeated in every page (which 
results in less code and smaller 
HTML pages). 
Therefore, once the user has 
downloaded the CSS stylesheet, 
the rest of the site will load 
faster. If you want to make a 
change to how your site appears, 
you only need to edit the one 
CSS file and all of your pages 
will be updated. For example, 
you can change the style of 
every <h1> element by altering 
the one CSS style sheet, rather 
than changing the CSS rules on 
every page. The HTML code 
will be easier to read and edit 
because it does not have lots of 
CSS rules in the same document. 
It is generally considered good 
practice to have the content of 
the site separated from the rules 
that determine how it appears.
