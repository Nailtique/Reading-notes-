My name is Sara, 

*I have a passion for Techno logy, design and coding. Development gives me a great sense of satisfaction, seeing immediate results of the job we are doing is full filing.*

I called myself **Nailtique** and i might change it to **NailTech** and it will be the name of my freelance hub where i will start from scratch to create , develop and work with software.

It is the power of women's nails on the laptop!
I have never been as excited in my life to learn something new, something that i have been longing for!

**wish me all the luck**
  
  ** MY GREATEST ACHIEVMENT WILL BE WHENEVER SOMEONE CLICKS ON THE BELOW WIKIPAGE, IT WILL BE FULL OF INOFRMATION ABOUT MY TECH FIRM!!**
