   # **Mindfulness is a popular way of becoming more conscious of our self, and more aware of how our consciousness and the world in which we live works. We can gain Insight into our    interconnectedness, and the realities of our existence. Mindfulness can lead to a greater openness and balance; it can also awaken within us a longing to go beyond ourselves.** #

  It leads us to an acceptance of ‘what is’, and an openness to ‘what may come’. Mindfulness leads to the inner realisation that our ordinary consciousness has limitations, and to    be truly free, open and balanced, we need to go beyond the limitations of our self. It awakens our yearning to reconnect with the Source, to respond to the call of the Spirit     that we can realise that it emanates from within This new state of consciousness leads us to a deeper insight, to a deeper awareness of the eternal divine Spirit-spark that is    within us, but not of us. We become aware that we are connected with the Spirit in us, but we realise that we are not yet consciously connected with It. We feel deeply our incompleteness, and we long to become whole.:gem:

**WireFrame**

it is more like a black and white abstract draft to a bigger project that we want to outreach :

## Examples :
- Wireframes drawn with paper and a pencil, or at a whiteboard, have the advantage of looking and being very easy to change, which can help tremendously in early conversations about your website or product.![wireframe](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83532083/116927610-8d2a5180-ac64-11eb-8177-e49f445b060f.jpg)

- With the help of paper-prototypes, you can test with end users at every stage of ideation and design. Changes at these stages are much easier—and therefore cheaper—than changes deemed necessary after coding is under way.
- Switching later to software (after initially hand-drawing your wireframe) allows you to keep track of more detailed decisions.





NOW :  # lets talk about semantics : 

IN any languge semantics is the lingusitc meaning, but in programing : Semantics describes the processes a computer follows when executing a program in that specific language. This can be shown by describing the relationship between the input and output of a program, or an explanation of how the program will be executed on a certain platform, hence creating a model of computation.
