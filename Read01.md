**What is Markdown?**


Markdown is a way to style text on the web.

 You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in.

**Mindfulness**

 Is a popular way of becoming more conscious of our self, and more aware of how our consciousness and the world in which we live works. We can gain Insight into our interconnectedness, and the realities of our existence. Mindfulness can lead to a greater openness and balance; it can also awaken within us a longing to go beyond ourselves.
 

It leads us to an acceptance of â€˜what isâ€™, and an openness to â€˜what may comeâ€™. Mindfulness leads to the inner realisation that our ordinary consciousness has limitations, and to be truly free, open and balanced, we need to go beyond the limitations of our self. It awakens our yearning to reconnect with the Source, to respond to the call of the Spirit that we can realise that it emanates from within This new state of consciousness leads us to a deeper insight, to a deeper awareness of the eternal divine Spirit-spark that is within us, but not of us. We become aware that we are connected with the Spirit in us, but we realise that we are not yet consciously connected with It. We feel deeply our incompleteness, and we long to become whole.ðŸ’Ž
