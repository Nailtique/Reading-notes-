Loops offer an easy way to do something repeatedly, redundnt of an order untill you get a result or not, the amount of repeat can start from zero, zero counts too.

**The statements for loops provided in JavaScript are:**
##

* for statement do...-
* while statement
* while statement
* labeled statement
* break statement
* continue statement
* for...in statement
* for...of statement

**A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop.**

do...while statement
The do...while statement repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.

A do...while statement looks as follows:

do
  statement
while (condition);
statement is always executed once before the condition is checked. (To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.)

If condition is true, the statement executes again. At the end of every execution, the condition is checked. When the condition is false, execution stops, and control passes to the statement following do...while.
